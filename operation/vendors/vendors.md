For the ones that have reps listed, we have good relationships with these people. Be kind to them!

## 🔧 Plumbing

### Winsupply
Often times the cheapest, but the location can be inconvenient. Best prices around for AO Smith. And they ship for free
Rep: Michael Agosto, [+1 (480) 772-1216](tel:14807721216) (Text or call)

### Hughes Supply
They don't have cast iron. Prices are decent and they're friendly. We like this place.

### Ferguson
They have cast iron

### Van Marcke
Most expensive but they have locations everywhere so it's better than driving across town for a single part.

## 🏠 Remodeling

### Studio 41
Best quality, best in-house designers. Pricey but their contractor prices are often times way below the list price, so it's easier to mark up the material when customers buy here.
